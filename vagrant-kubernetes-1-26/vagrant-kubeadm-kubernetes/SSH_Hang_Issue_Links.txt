nstall the plugin:

vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest 

Let vagrant up it will install the virtual box client if needed. If you want to force the installation you can run 

vagrant vbguest --do install 


Consider also upgrading your VM box by:

vagrant box update

==========================

I was able to overcome this error by uninstalling the vagrant-vbguest plugin:

vagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-vbguest

then, 

vagrant halt and vagrant up.
